# credit-card-fraud-detection

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project repository! 
This project is designed to detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. We've implemented various strategies to tackle the class imbalance issue typically associated with fraud detection datasets. Our approach includes the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for data augmentation. 
**Project Highlights :**
Class Imbalance Management: We've effectively addressed this issue using SMOTE to create synthetic samples of the minority class. 
Classification Algorithms: We've explored multiple classification algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression,
Hyperparameter Tuning: We've fine-tuned the hyperparameters of our models using GridSearchCV. 

This project is a part of our coursework in data science and machine learning at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal.
